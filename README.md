## Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend folder:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the backend server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   (Replace `app.py` with your main backend file if different.)

5. **API Endpoints:**
   - The backend should expose endpoints for password analysis, hash analysis, encoding/decoding, encryption/decryption, etc.
   - By default, it runs on `http://localhost:5000` (or as configured).

---

## Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend folder:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the React development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - By default, this runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Configuration:**
   - Ensure your frontend is configured to call the backend API (update API base URL if needed).

---

## Local Development

- **Start the backend first**, then the frontend.  
- The frontend will make requests to the backend API.
- If required, set up a proxy in `frontend/package.json`:
  ```json
  "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
  ```

---

## GitHub Workflow

- **Clone the repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Durgesh2202/password-strength-web.git
  ```

- **Branches:**  
  - Use feature branches (e.g., `feature/frontend-ui`, `feature/api-endpoints`) for new work.
  - Submit Pull Requests for code reviews and merges.

- **Issues:**  
  - Track bugs, enhancements, and tasks via GitHub Issues.

- **Commits:**  
  - Write clear, descriptive commit messages.

---

## Netlify Deployment

**Deploying the React frontend on Netlify:**

1. **Set build settings in Netlify:**
   - **Base directory:**  
     Leave empty (or set to `frontend` if you use `netlify.toml`)
   - **Build command:**  
     `cd frontend && npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:**  
     `frontend/build`

   _OR use a `netlify.toml` file:_
   ```toml
   [build]
   base = "frontend"
   command = "npm run build"
   publish = "build"
   ```

2. **Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify.**
3. **Trigger a deploy.**
4. **Your live site will be available at your Netlify URL.**

## Additional Notes

- **Backend Hosting:**  
  - To make the backend API accessible for production, deploy to a cloud provider (Heroku, AWS, Render, etc.).
  - Update the frontend API base URL for production.

- **Environment Variables:**  
  - Store sensitive keys in `.env` files (never commit them to GitHub).

- **Security:**  
  - Always validate and sanitize user inputs.
  - Use HTTPS for production deployments.

- **Contributions:**  
  - Open to pull requests and issues!
  - Please follow the code style guides and review process.
